The lost carving technique articles from defunct
[Bomber Online][old-bomber-site], rewritten to be mobile friendly.

Written in the 90's, during the peak of
[*Alpine Snowboarding*][alpine-snowboarding][^1] and it's subtypes:  
*Freecarving*[^2] & [*Alpine Snowboard Racing*][snowboard-racing][^3].

The techniques *transfer fully* to softboot **Snowboarding**[^4].

## Footnotes

[^1]: **Alpine Snowboarding** is a specific type of snowboarding performed in
      hardshell ski-like boots & plate bindings; focuses on high-performance
      technical carving.  

[^2]: **Freecarving** is a carving style that converts potential energy to
      *g-force*.  
      **Race Carving** converts energy to *high downhill speed*.  
      Both started as disciplines of *Alpine Snowboarding*.

[^3]: **Alpine Snowboard Racing** refers to the Olympic events of
      **Parallel Slalom(PSL)** and **Parallel Giant Slalom(PGS)**.  
      Still only performed on *Alpine Snowboard* gear & techniques.

[^4]: The usual snowboarding everyone knows; riding in soft boots and
      strap bindings, commonly called just *"Snowboarding"*.  
      Only called *"Softboot Snowboarding"* when comparing it to
      *Alpine Snowboarding* which uses hardboots and plate bindings.
