# The Toeside Problem

By Jack Michaud

After we learn how to carve turns on our snowboards with regularity
and some confidence, an interesting transformation typically
occurs. Most carvers start with a preference for toeside carves. But
as we progress, at some point our strength switches to heelside for
many people, almost overnight. Henceforth, the balance between
heelside and toeside is commonly never achieved, and toeside carves
perpetually lag behind heelside in terms of power and confidence. The
disparity can just be a niggling flaw, or a perplexing handicap. It
doesn't have to be this way.

If you have not reached the point where your heelside outcarves your
toeside, take this article as a preventative measure.
The early toeside preference is probably related to the fact that on
toeside, it is easier to tilt a board up on edge high enough to really
make an aggressive carve happen at lower speeds. The alpine hook is
usually set on a beginner's first successful toeside carve. However,
eventually we learn how to tilt that board up high on heelside edge
too. This allows us to go faster. Additionally, it is easier to
angulate and inclinate on heelside at higher speed. Ironically, we are
then able to reach speeds where bad toeside habits come back to haunt
us, and then suddenly the heelside edge feels like the security
blanket.

The reason heelside can feel like the stronger carve for many of us
may have a simple explanation: the structure of the body naturally
makes it easier to put our center of gravity (our hips or thereabouts)
in just the right spot on heelside, but not so easy on toeside. It
also makes it easier to angulate and "stack" our upper body on top of
our center of gravity. On heelside, you probably just fall into this
position naturally without even thinking about it. On toeside, it is
common for people to want to turn slightly and face the toeside
edge and the hill, and bend at the waist. We also tend to put that
back hand down for a comforting sense of safety or as an expression of
style.

This subconscious desire to quickly and cheaply get closer to the
snow on toeside results in something that will prevent our toeside
carves from ever matching our heelsides: sticking your ass in the air,
and reaching for the snow.

Heelside carves are stronger because your center of gravity
automatically goes down and in. Notice the positioning of the hips in
these heelside carves, and the position of the upper body relative to
the hips:

The hips are down and in the carve, the upper body is stacked on top
of them. This is a strong, balanced position. It is natural and
relatively easy to "drop" the hips into a heelside
carve. Now, compare the above pictures with these toeside carves and
notice the distinct difference in the position of the hips, and the
relative position of the upper body. Let's call this the "A" group:

The hips are up and out. This is the exact opposite of what usually
happens naturally on heelside. This is an unbalanced position. The
center of gravity is high, so to compensate the rider tilts their
upper body down into the carve, and reaches for the snow. Be not
ashamed if you ride like this. It is very common, and it is the
natural result of innate defense mechanisms. We have ALL been
there. It just takes a little concentration and some practice to
overcome it. This problem is typical among new and intermediate
carvers, and it often stays with people well after they have
progressed to advanced or even expert status. It is possible to work
around this and learn how to carve fairly strongly and even to layout
carves low to the ground with one's tush up on display. However odds
are that even expert carvers who ride like this would confess they
favor their heelside carves.

So how do we fix this? Simple. We take that nice down-and-in hip
position from our heelside carves and make it happen on toeside. But
how? Drop the hips into the toeside carve. Well, first we have to talk
about body alignment relative to the nose of your board. Racers and
race coaches will tell you to face your binding angles. Some people
like to face the nose of their boards. Who's right? In my opinion, as
long as you are facing your binding angles, or the nose of your board,
or somewhere in between, you're doing just fine for
freecarving. Unfortunately, it only takes a very small twist towards
your toeside edge with your hips, knees or shoulders to cause
problems. Many people who think they are facing their binding angles
on toeside are actually turned slightly back, towards the
edge. Usually this is compounded by a bend at the waist, a reach for
the ground, and then it's all over.

Next, we need to talk about sequence. Our carcasses must cross the
board between carves in some order of body parts. In the toeside
pictures above, it is probably safe to assume that the order went
something like hands, head, shoulders, hips, knees. Again, this is the
exact opposite of what we want. When you're really railing
solid cross-through carves, the order should be knees, hips, upper
body. In any case, the goal is to drop the hips into the toeside carve
before your upper body. If your heelside carve feels better, that's
probably what you're doing on that side. So do it on toeside too!

Take a look at these toeside carves. Let's call this the "B" group:

The hips are down and in, just like on heelside. One very important
thing to notice here is that in these not-so-laid-out toesides above,
the B riders have their hips about as far or farther into the carve as
their counterparts do in the A group. But the B's heads and shoulders
are nowhere near as leaned over or tipped in as the A's. Both group's
bodies form somewhat of a "C" shape, but curving in opposite
directions. The result is better balance, and greater range of motion
for the B riders. Okay, so what happens when you crank up the volume?

Hips down is the way to go. Notice the above riders' knees and hips
and how close they are to the snow, yet the shoulders, hips, knees,
and feet are all still in line. This is a stacked, balanced
position. Your upper body remains quietly suspended directly by your
lower body. You can relax and concentrate on absorbing the terrain
and holding that edge with your legs. When the upper body gets tilted
off to the side as in the A group, it is no longer above or in line
with the center of gravity. In this position it becomes much harder
to balance because your suspension system is now bent in the
middle. Your upper body is not supported by bone structure, so you
have to compensate with brute muscle force.

So if your heelside carve is obviously your stronger carve, try the
toeside hip-drop. First you need to make sure you're not rotating your
hips slightly towards your toe edge. At a heel-to-toe transition, take
your back hip (right hip for regulars, left for goofies) and bring it
forward. Think about putting it just in front of your back foot. Then,
drop that hip down towards the snow and into the toeside carve. Do
this before any movement of your hands, head or shoulders towards the
snow. Concentrate on "pencil pinching" (as mentioned in other articles
here) to keep your upper body upright - that is, you should feel like
you could hold a pencil in the crease that forms between your downhill
hip and rib cage. Stomp the front foot to start the carve, then
smoothly shift back as the carve comes around, finishing the carve
with your weight about two-thirds on your back foot. When you master
the hip drop and combine it with quick cross-through transitions,
you'll probably find that confidence on toeside that you've been
enjoying on heelside all this time.
